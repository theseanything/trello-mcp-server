## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.12 or higher, can easly managed by `uv`
2. [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed
3. Trello account and API credentials
4. [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager installed

## Pre-installation

1. Make sure you have installed Claude Desktop App
2. Make sure you have already logged in with your account into Claude.
3. Start Claude

## Installation

1. Set up Trello API credentials:

   - Go to [Trello Apps Administration](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin)
   - Create a new integration at [New Power-Up or Integration](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin/new)
   - Fill in your information (you can leave the Iframe connector URL empty) and make sure to select the correct Workspace
   - Click your app's icon and navigate to "API key" from left sidebar.
   - Copy your "API key" and on the right side: "you can manually generate a Token." click the word token to get your Trello Token.

2. Rename the `.env.example` file in the project root with `.env` and set vairables you just got:

```bash
TRELLO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
TRELLO_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

3. Install uv if you haven't already:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

4. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m0xai/trello-mcp-server.git
cd trello-mcp-server
```

5. Install dependencies and set server for Claude using uv::

```bash
uv run mcp install main.py
```

6. Restart Claude Desktop app

## Server Modes

This MCP server can run in two different modes:

### Claude App Mode

This mode integrates directly with the Claude Desktop application:

1. Set `USE_CLAUDE_APP=true` in your `.env` file (this is the default)
2. Run the server with:

```bash
uv run mcp install main.py
```

3. Restart the Claude Desktop application

### SSE Server Mode

This mode runs as a standalone SSE server that can be used with any MCP-compatible client, including Cursor:

1. Set `USE_CLAUDE_APP=false` in your `.env` file
2. Run the server with:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. The server will be available at `http://localhost:8000` by default (or your configured port)

### Docker Mode

You can also run the server using Docker Compose:

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed
2. Create your `.env` file with your configuration
3. Build and start the container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. The server will run in SSE mode by default
5. To view logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

6. To stop the server:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Configuration

The server can be configured using environment variables in the `.env` file:

| Variable        | Description                    | Default           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| TRELLO_API_KEY  | Your Trello API key            | Required          |
| TRELLO_TOKEN    | Your Trello API token          | Required          |
| MCP_SERVER_NAME | The name of the MCP server     | Trello MCP Server |
| MCP_SERVER_HOST | Host address for SSE mode      | 0.0.0.0           |
| MCP_SERVER_PORT | Port for SSE mode              | 8000              |
| USE_CLAUDE_APP  | Whether to use Claude app mode | true              |

You can customize the server by editing these values in your `.env` file.

## Client Integration

### Using with Claude Desktop

1. Run the server in Claude app mode (`USE_CLAUDE_APP=true`)
2. Start or restart Claude Desktop
3. Claude will automatically detect and connect to your MCP server

### Using with Cursor

To connect your MCP server to Cursor:

1. Run the server in SSE mode (`USE_CLAUDE_APP=false`)
2. In Cursor, go to Settings (gear icon) > AI > Model Context Protocol
3. Add a new server with URL `http://localhost:8000` (or your configured host/port)
4. Select the server when using Cursor's AI features

You can also add this configuration to your Cursor settings JSON file (typically at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trello": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### Using with Other MCP Clients

For other MCP-compatible clients, point them to the SSE endpoint at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Minimal Client Example

Here's a minimal Python example to connect to the SSE endpoint:

```python
import asyncio
import httpx

async def connect_to_mcp_server():
    url = "http://localhost:8000/sse"
    headers = {"Accept": "text/event-stream"}

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        async with client.stream("GET", url, headers=headers) as response:
            # Get the session ID from the first SSE message
            session_id = None
            async for line in response.aiter_lines():
                if line.startswith("data:"):
                    data = line[5:].strip()
                    if "session_id=" in data and not session_id:
                        session_id = data.split("session_id=")[1]

                        # Send a message using the session ID
                        message_url = f"http://localhost:8000/messages/?session_id={session_id}"
                        message = {
                            "role": "user",
                            "content": {
                                "type": "text",
                                "text": "Show me my Trello boards"
                            }
                        }
                        await client.post(message_url, json=message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(connect_to_mcp_server())
```

If you encounter issues:

1. Verify your Trello API credentials in the `.env` file
2. Check that you have proper permissions in your Trello workspace
3. Ensure Claude for Desktop is running the latest version
